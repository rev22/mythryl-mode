Mythryl is a safe, functional programming language, derived by Cynbe
ru Taren from SML/NJ, but featuring a clear, more programmer-friendly
syntax.  See http://mythryl.org for more.


Usage
-----

Activate mythryl-mode for an Emacs buffer:

  M-x mythryl-mode

Execute an interactive Mythryl session:
  
  M-x run-mythryl

Customize indentation and fontification of Mythryl code:

  M-x customize-group mythryl


Installation
------------

To use this mode, install this file in your elisp load path; then
insert the expression:

  (load "mythryl-mode")

in your .emacs file.

Other useful lines for your .emacs (to automatically activate
mythryl-mode for .pkg .api and .mythryl files)

  ;; for .pkg and .api files
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (append '(("\\.pkg$" . mythryl-mode)
                  ("\\.api$" . mythryl-mode)
                  ("\\.mythryl$" . mythryl-mode))
                auto-mode-alist))

  ;; for scripts starting with #!/.../mythryl
  (setq interpreter-mode-alist
        (append '(("mythryl" . mythryl-mode))
                interpreter-mode-alist))


Alternatively, installation via a Debian package is possible on

After the tragic loss of the original author and maintainer Phil Rand in 2011
I (Michele) decided to enlist as a maintainer.
